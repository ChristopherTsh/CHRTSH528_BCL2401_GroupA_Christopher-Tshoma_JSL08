# BankBranch Singleton

This code is like a magic spell for creating a special kind of bank branch. 🪄✨

## Overview

So, what's the deal with this `BankBranch` class? Well, it's like a superhero cape for representing a bank branch. 🏦

Here's the secret sauce: We want only one instance of this class to exist at a time. Imagine it's the only cookie left in the jar—no duplicates! 🍪

## Implementation

How do we make this happen? We've got a cool trick up our sleeves:
- We use a special variable called `bankBranchInstance`. It's like a secret vault for our one and only branch.
- When someone tries to create a new instance, we check if `bankBranchInstance` is empty. If it is, we create a new branch and store it there. If not, we just hand out the existing branch.
- It's like having a VIP pass to the coolest bank party! 🎉

## Usage

Ready to use this magic spell? Here's how:
1. Open your JavaScript file (it's like your spellbook).
2. Add the `BankBranch` class to your code. It's like summoning a friendly ghost.
3. Create your branch using the `new` keyword. Pass in the branch name (like "Main Branch").
   ```javascript
   const branchA = new BankBranch("Main Branch");
   ```
   Ta-da! You've got your very own bank branch. Now go make some financial magic! 💰🌟
